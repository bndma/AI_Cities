# AI_Cities - Simulated Annealing (Java)

## Description
The objective of the this code is to determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

The solution uses a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the physical annealing process, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima and explore the search space more effectively.
